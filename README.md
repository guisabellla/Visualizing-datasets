# Visualizing Datasets

## Plot 1: US vs. China GDP (2000-2023)
![graph1.](C:\Users\GuShuaiqi\Documents\GitHub\Visualizing-datasets\images\GDP figure.png)
This line graph is generated based on the datasets from [awesome-json-datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets) under the subtitle "GDP". 
Both datasets are json files, which provide United State and China's GDP value of each year in US dollars. The python file that generates the graph is [GDP.py](GDP.py)

## Plot 2: Causes of Deaths in United States (2017)
![graph2.](images\Causes of Death.png)
This bar graph is generated based on the dataset from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?res_format=JSON&res_format=CSV&page=2).
The file name is "NCHS - Leading Causes of Death: United States", and I generate the graph based on the CSV file. I only selected numbers of deaths in year 2017 and a few causes of death. Not all causes are included. The python file that generate the graph is [Death_cause.py](Death_cause.py)

This project is created under the instruction of course [cmc-csci040 project_02](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2025spring/project_02_visualizing_datasets).
